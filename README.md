# EV Charging Monitor for Raspberry Pi

**A Python script for monitoring a local wallbox charging station and sending notifications via Discord, ntfy, or Pushover.**  

Currently supported wallboxes: 
* NewMotion / Shell Recharge [tested with Business Pro 2.1]

If you want to support addind new EV Chargers, [read here](https://github.com/bjoerrrn/EV-Charging-Monitor-for-Raspberry-Pi/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#-adding-support-for-new-wallbox-models) how to. 

## Features
- Reads charging rate and consumed energy from a web-based wallbox interface.
- Uses **Selenium** to extract data dynamically.
- Supported notification channels: Discord, ntfy, Pushover
- Sends notifications when charging starts, stops, and after 5 minutes: charging rate.
- Sends a notification after charging stopped or interrupted, summarizing consumed energy and time.
- If a fixed price per kWh is configured, the energy consumed between cable connected/disconnected will be summarized in Euro.
- Sends a notification when the cable was connected or disconnected. Also handles short-time unavailabilities of the status page to avoid false-positives.
- Typically, wallboxes sometimes consume energy as long as a cable is connected. **Prevents false positives** by only detecting charging rates above **1.0 kW**.

## Setup & Installation  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies**
On a **Raspberry Pi**, run:  
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y chromium-browser chromium-chromedriver
sudo apt install -y python3-requests python3-selenium python3-bs4 python3-urllib3
```

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Clone This Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bjoerrrn/wallbox-monitoring.git
cd wallbox-monitoring/
```

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Configure Your Script**

wallbox_monitor.credo: This file contains sensitive credentials, hence the .credo extension. 

Open wallbox_monitor.credo and set:
-	Wallbox URL: Change
```
WALLBOX_URL = http://<your-local-wallbox-ip>:12800/user/user.html
```

-	Discord Webhook: Replace
```
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL = <your-discord-webhook-url>
```

- and/or ntfy:
```
NTFY_TOPIC = <your_ntfy_topic>
```

- and/or Pushover:
```
PUSHOVER_USER_KEY = <your_pushover_user_key>
PUSHOVER_API_TOKEN = <your_pushover_api_token>
```

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Script**

Manual Execution
```bash
python3 wallbox_monitor.py
```

Run Every Minute with Crontab
```bash
crontab -e
```

Add the following line at the bottom:
```bash
* * * * * /usr/bin/python3 /home/pi/wallbox-monitor/wallbox_monitor.py
```
Replace /home/pi/wallbox-monitor/ with your actual script path.

Save and exit.

### **üì° Expected Output**

üì¢ Notifications

```
üîå 02.02.25, 09:50: Cable connected.
‚ö° 02.02.25, 22:20: charging started.
‚è≥ charging power: 3.55 kW
üîã 02.02.25, 23:30: charging stopped.
üîç consumed: 3.75 kWh of 15.92 kWh in 01:10 h
üîå 02.02.25, 23:50: Cable disconnected.
üí∂ total: 15.92 kWh = 5.57 ‚Ç¨
```

### **üìù Logging**

Check logs in:
```bash
cat /home/pi/wallbox-monitor/wallbox_monitor.log
```

If you want to show additional debug output in wallbox_monitor.log, add `DEBUG_MODE=True` in crontab:
```bash
* * * * * DEBUG_MODE=True /usr/bin/python3 /home/pi/wallbox-monitor/wallbox_monitor.py
```

.. or in your shell to debug manually:
```bash
export DEBUG_MODE=True
./wallbox_monitor.py
```

#### **External Logging Script Support**

You can configure an external script to be executed whenever the charging state changes. The script will receive a JSON payload containing session details.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Edit your 'wallbox_monitor.credo' file

Add the following line with the path to your external script:
```
EXTERNAL_LOG_SCRIPT = /path/to/your/log_script.sh
```

2Ô∏è‚É£ Ensure your script is executable

```bash
chmod +x /path/to/your/log_script.sh
```

3Ô∏è‚É£ JSON Data Format Passed to the Script:

```json
{
    "state": "charging",
    "start_time": "1739959209.48",
    "stored_power": 1.26,
    "total_energy_kWh": 20.0,
    "notified": 1,
    "repeat_check": 0
}
```

5Ô∏è‚É£ Run and Verify

Whenever the script detects a change in the charging state, it will execute log_script.sh, passing the charging data in JSON format.


### **üõ† Troubleshooting**

#### Selenium Fails: ‚ÄúNoSuchDriverException‚Äù

Try reinstalling chromedriver:
```bash
sudo apt install --reinstall chromium-chromedriver
```

#### Charging or Consumed Energy Not Detected

Run debug script:
```bash
python3 test_consumed_debug.py
```
